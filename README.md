# DifferentialGeneAnalysis
**Project Title: A Differential Gene Analysis**

**Description:** This program is able to conduct a differential gene analysis between healthy and cancer patients. It will provide users with a volcano plot and allow users to highlight genes of interest that are either upregulated or downregulated.

**Installation:** The files in this repository are specifically 6 healthy breast samples and 6 tumor breast samples. The program could be ran with different samples downloaded from TCGA Database ([https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga](url))

**Configuration:** If you are going to run this program with different samples then you will need to ensure that the files you download are read into tables in the beginning of the program.
